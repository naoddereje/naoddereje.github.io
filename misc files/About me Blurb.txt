A Little About Me...

I am a third year Computer Enginnering Student currently studying at Queen's University in Kingston, ON.
I was 1 out of 50 students chosen to be a part of their Electrical and Computer Innovation Stream (ECEi). 
This has given me the oppurutnity to work closely with many other students in the same field as me and kick start my
goal of becoming a more technology focused individual. Additionally, the innovation stream has given me a glance into
business and entrepeneurship at the critically acclaimed Smith School of Business. 


My Work as a *Software Engineer*

Throughout my two years at Queen's I have found many gateways into the field of software development that have helped me to understand

This meant that we were able to qualify for world competition, despite it being put on hold due to COVID-19.

My Work as a *Mentor*

Throughout my time at Queen's, I have also assimiliated into a role as a mentor for the many new first year students that are coming to

The program has helped many incoming first years from crescent feel at home with their fellow brothers, and I am proud to have made a contribution
in making the new boys feel just a little bit more at home in their time at Queens.

What's Next?
As a software developer, I know my work is never done. I will continue to work on projects, continue to push the limits of my
